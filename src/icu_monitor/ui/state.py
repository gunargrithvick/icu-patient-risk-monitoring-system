"""Engine lifecycle for the dashboard.

The dashboard reuses :class:`~icu_monitor.api.deps.AppState` rather than growing its own
engine owner. That class already solves the two problems a Streamlit front end has - build
the engine once, and advance the ward only when the last snapshot has gone stale - and
sharing it means the dashboard and the HTTP API cannot drift into two different definitions
of "the current state of the ward".

Streamlit reruns the whole script on every interaction, so the engine must live outside the
script run. ``st.cache_resource`` is the right primitive: one instance per process, keyed on
the settings that would invalidate it. ``st.session_state`` would rebuild the ward for every
browser tab, and a module global would not survive a code reload.
